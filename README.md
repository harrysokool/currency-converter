## A Currency Converter

- This application will allow users to transfer one currency to another
currency with a live currency rate. There will be multiple currencies
for the user to select. Many people will use currency converters
because these days, people travel around the world very frequently,
so it is essential to check the local currency rate. Online shopping 
has become increasingly popular, and people buy items at different
websites from different countries. Therefore, it is important to check
the price of another currency. 

- This project is very interesting because it helps people to know
whether it is the right time to exchange their money for another
currency or not because sometimes a country's currency may drop and 
Currency converter can check whether it is the right time or not, it
helps to determine it. It also helps to determine a country's economic
health.
